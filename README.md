# Bad numbers
Bad numbers is the task when an operator need to have the information whether a person responds a call (mark the phone number as good number) or not (mark the number as bad). 
Incoming data is a history report of previous callings and their results. The task is to process the data and predict if the prone is good, so it can be used for work with the client or bad so the phone number should be moved from the working data.
